This repository doesn't have any code 🤷🏻. 

I like using images to describe what I'm doing when I'm writing readme files for my GitHub repositories. 
Since markdown files can only display images via a public link, I created this repo to upload my images. 
GitHub would then create a pulic link to these images that I can use for my other ReadMe's. Talk about round-aboutness haha. 🤪
